# Lab 4: Map Design and Tile Generation

**Student:**

This lab workout demonstrates the design of Maps and Tiles

Tiles are a effective way to render maps and geographic data on the client side rather than on the server side. Here, layers have been applied to see data from different perspectives

## 1. Project URL

Here is the GitHub link accessible from the web: 

## 2. Screenshots 



## 3. The Geographic Area of Interest

This project has laid focus on The United States

One of the layer's data source depicts the US Population data as of 2019. Source: https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/choropleth-studio-gl-pt-1/

The other tile set shows the Covid Counts in US as of year 2020. Folked from previous project (Lab03)

## 4. Zoom Levels for Each Tile Set

Each tile set has a minimum zoom level of **1** as set during Tile generation in QGIS
The maximum zoom level for each is **14**
